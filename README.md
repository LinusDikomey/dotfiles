# Installation
The `install` script is provided to setup all my configuration more or less from scratch on a new arch system.
After setting up arch, creating your user and setting up permissions, just install git and run this:
```bash
cd ~ && git clone https://github.com/LinusDikomey/dotfiles && ./dotfiles/install
```
After that, everything *should* work as expected.
